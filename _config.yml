about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm a Ph.D. student in mathematics at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu), advised by [Curtis McMullen](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/).
  My main research interests are geometry and dynamics of moduli space and hyperbolic surfaces.
  I'm also broadly interested in Teichmüller theory, Ergodic theory and translation surfaces.
  Find my CV [here](files/ttorkaman_cv.pdf).

#I am most skilled in: <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

      <h2>At Harvard:</h2>
      - Multivariable Calculus

        I thought math 21a in Fall 2019 and I earned a [Certificate of Distinction in Teaching](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-awards) by [the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/home) at Harvard.

        I thought math 21a in spring 2021 and it was completly remote.
      - Direct reading program(DRP)

          I mentored an undergraduate student in Fall 2020 to study ergodic theory. The final project was about Szemerédi's theorem.

        #  During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

        #  I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
